        <h2>Why Tacoma?</h2>
        <h3>Tacoma, a city shaped by glass and grit</h3>
        <p>
          Known affectionately as Grit City, Tacoma wears its history with
          pride. Once a bustling port and industrial powerhouse, the city has
          transformed itself without losing its edge. That same raw
          determination pulses through its art — especially in the work of Dale
          Chihuly, Tacoma native and pioneer of modern glass. His influence runs
          deep, most famously across the Bridge of Glass: a vibrant, open-air
          installation that spans from downtown to the Museum of Glass,
          shimmering with bold color and delicate form.<br /><br />

          The bridge stands as a symbol of Tacoma’s identity — equal parts
          beauty and backbone. Beneath the delicate sculptures lies a foundation
          built on resilience, shaped by a community that values both hard work
          and creative risk. It’s this balance of fire and finesse that defines
          Tacoma, where art doesn’t just adorn the city — it rises from it.
